## Overview

The main goal of this project is to showcase how to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The repository contains a single Python script, `main.py`, which performs a basic operation. The CI/CD workflow is triggered automatically on each push to the main branch.

## Workflow

The CI/CD workflow in this project consists of the following steps:

1. **Build:** Checks out the code and sets up the Python environment.
2. **Test:** Runs unit tests on the Python script to ensure its functionality.
3. **Deploy:** If the tests pass, deploys the Python script or its artifacts. (Note: In this example, deployment is kept minimal.)

The workflow configuration is defined in the [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml) file.

## Getting Started

To run this CI/CD example locally or integrate it into your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CI-CD.git
   cd CI-CD
   ```

2. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Explore GitHub Actions:**
   - Open the [Actions tab](https://github.com/your-username/CI-CD/actions) in your GitHub repository to view CI/CD workflow runs.
   - Review the workflow configuration in [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml) to understand the pipeline.

4. **Customize as Needed:**
   - Modify the workflow, script, or other components based on your project requirements.
